# .net-core-udemy-1

BulkyBookWeb is a current project that I have been doing in my spare time. Iâ€™m following the [Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-21-course/) from GitHub user [bhrugen](https://github.com/bhrugen) on creating an ASP.NET Core 6 application using Entity Framework. 

So far, I have created two projects, Abby, which gives me an understanding of how to use Razor pages and BulkyBookWeb, which implements the MVC framework and handles repository patterns and units of work.

The completed project from bhrugen is [linked here.](https://github.com/bhrugen/Bulky)
